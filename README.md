# adf_d256_parse
* Currently parses ADF files

TODO
* Data validation for D256 files - (current task) - Using a BDD style Reject class
* TSYS state machine (Next task)

* Tests
    **Note** the TSYS, ADF, MetaClasses python files are not tested, they were 
    autogenerated with camelot and interpolated strings
    - Those classes are the bulk of the repo, all further development will follow TDD best practices.
